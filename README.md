Hello all users!
	Thank you for using S.T.E.L.L.A.R.! S.T.E.L.L.A.R. is an abbreviation of 
Supermassive black hole Terminal-based mass Estimator through Local Luminary Apparent Revolutions.  The purpose of this program is to permit users to calculate the mass of Sagittarius A* using many stars. This modular program uses multiple files to aid in the working of the file.

This program relies on the use of Kepler’s third law. Kepler’s third law is a way of describing the orbit of a smaller body around a parent body. As it turns out, this is greatly beneficial. Since supermassive black holes, such as Sagittarius A* at the center of the Milky-Way galaxy, are extremely hard to directly observe, it is easier to observe the orbits of some nearby stars and their properties as they orbit the black hole.

A study of some 39 stars orbiting Sagittarius A*  was used as the basis for this program (Gillessen et al, 2017), however the modular nature of the program means that it is extremely simple to expand the amount of stars being studied.
